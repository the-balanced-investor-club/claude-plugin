## DCF Process Workflow

### Step 1: Data Retrieval and Validation

Fetch data from MCP servers, user provided data, and the web.

**Data Sources Priority:**
1. **The Balanced Investor Club connector** - Structured financials (get_fundamentals, get_income_statement, get_balance_sheet, get_cash_flow)
2. **User-Provided Data** - Historical financials from their research
3. **`get_valuation_inputs`** — price, shares, beta, net debt, trailing FCF, 4-year FCF history and CAGR, and the risk-free rate, **in a single call**. It replaces five separate lookups. Never web search for any of them.

**Validation Checklist:**
- Verify net debt vs net cash (critical for valuation)
- Confirm diluted shares outstanding (check for recent buybacks/issuances)
- Validate historical margins are consistent with business model
- Cross-check revenue growth rates with industry benchmarks
- Verify tax rate is reasonable (typically 21-28%)

### Step 2: Historical Analysis (3-5 years)

Analyze and document:
- **Revenue growth trends**: Calculate CAGR, identify drivers
- **Margin progression**: Track gross margin, EBIT margin, FCF margin
- **Capital intensity**: D&A and CapEx as % of revenue
- **Working capital efficiency**: NWC changes as % of revenue growth
- **Return metrics**: ROIC, ROE trends

Create summary tables showing:
```
Historical Metrics (LTM):
Revenue: $X million
Revenue growth: X% CAGR
Gross margin: X%
EBIT margin: X%
D&A % of revenue: X%
CapEx % of revenue: X%
FCF margin: X%
```

### Step 3: Build Revenue Projections

**Methodology:**
1. Start with latest actual revenue (LTM or most recent fiscal year)
2. Apply growth rates for each projection year
3. Show both dollar amounts AND calculated growth %

**Growth Rate Framework:**
- Year 1-2: Higher growth reflecting near-term visibility
- Year 3-4: Gradual moderation toward industry average
- Year 5+: Approaching terminal growth rate

**Formula structure:**
- Revenue(Year N) = Revenue(Year N-1) × (1 + Growth Rate)
- Growth %(Year N) = Revenue(Year N) / Revenue(Year N-1) - 1

**Three-scenario approach:**
```
Bear Case: Conservative growth (e.g., 8-12%)
Base Case: Most likely scenario (e.g., 12-16%)
Bull Case: Optimistic growth (e.g., 16-20%)
```

### Step 4: Operating Expense Modeling

**Fixed/Variable Cost Analysis:**

Operating expenses should model realistic operating leverage:
- **Sales & Marketing**: Typically 15-40% of revenue depending on business model
- **Research & Development**: Typically 10-30% for technology companies
- **General & Administrative**: Typically 8-15% of revenue, shows leverage as company scales

**Key principles:**
- ALL percentages based on REVENUE, not gross profit
- Model operating leverage: % should decline as revenue scales
- Maintain separate line items for S&M, R&D, G&A
- Calculate EBIT = Gross Profit - Total OpEx

**Margin expansion framework:**
```
Current State → Target State (Year 5)
Gross Margin: X% → Y% (justify based on scale, efficiency)
EBIT Margin: X% → Y% (result of revenue growth + opex leverage)
```

### Step 5: Free Cash Flow Calculation

**Build FCF in proper sequence:**

```
EBIT
(-) Taxes (EBIT × Tax Rate)
= NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax)
(+) D&A (non-cash expense, % of revenue)
(-) CapEx (% of revenue, typically 4-8%)
(-) Δ NWC (change in working capital)
= Unlevered Free Cash Flow
```

**Working Capital Modeling:**
- Calculate as % of revenue change (delta revenue)
- Typical range: -2% to +2% of revenue change
- Negative number = source of cash (working capital release)
- Positive number = use of cash (working capital build)

**Maintenance vs Growth CapEx:**
- Maintenance CapEx: Sustains current operations (~2-3% revenue)
- Growth CapEx: Supports expansion (additional 2-5% revenue)
- Total CapEx should align with company's growth strategy

### Step 6: Cost of Capital (WACC) Research

**CAPM Methodology for Cost of Equity:**

```
Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × Equity Risk Premium

Where:
- Risk-Free Rate = Current 10-Year Treasury Yield
- Beta = 5-year monthly stock beta vs market index
- Equity Risk Premium = 5.0-6.0% (market standard)
```

**Cost of Debt Calculation:**

```
After-Tax Cost of Debt = Pre-Tax Cost of Debt × (1 - Tax Rate)

Determine Pre-Tax Cost of Debt from:
- Credit rating (if available)
- Current yield on company bonds
- Interest expense / Total Debt from financials
```

**Capital Structure Weights:**

```
Market Value Equity = Current Stock Price × Shares Outstanding
Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Net Debt

Equity Weight = Market Cap / Enterprise Value
Debt Weight = Net Debt / Enterprise Value

WACC = (Cost of Equity × Equity Weight) + (After-Tax Cost of Debt × Debt Weight)
```

**Special Cases:**
- **Net Cash Position**: If Cash > Debt, Net Debt is NEGATIVE
  - Debt Weight may be negative
  - WACC calculation adjusts accordingly
- **No Debt**: WACC = Cost of Equity

**Typical WACC Ranges:**
- Large Cap, Stable: 7-9%
- Growth Companies: 9-12%
- High Growth/Risk: 12-15%

### Step 7: Discount Rate Application (5-10 Year Forecast)

**Mid-Year Convention:**
- Cash flows assumed to occur mid-year
- Discount Period: 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, etc.
- Discount Factor = 1 / (1 + WACC)^Period

**Present Value Calculation:**
```
For each projection year:
PV of FCF = Unlevered FCF × Discount Factor

Example (Year 1):
FCF = $1,000
WACC = 10%
Period = 0.5
Discount Factor = 1 / (1.10)^0.5 = 0.9535
PV = $1,000 × 0.9535 = $954
```

**Projection Period Selection:**
- **5 years**: Standard for most analyses
- **7-10 years**: High growth companies with longer runway
- **3 years**: Mature, stable businesses

### Step 8: Terminal Value Calculation

**Perpetuity Growth Method (Preferred):**

```
Terminal FCF = Final Year FCF × (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)
Terminal Value = Terminal FCF / (WACC - Terminal Growth Rate)

Critical Constraint: Terminal Growth < WACC (otherwise infinite value)
```

**Terminal Growth Rate Selection:**
- Conservative: 2.0-2.5% (GDP growth rate)
- Moderate: 2.5-3.5%
- Aggressive: 3.5-5.0% (only for market leaders)

**Do not exceed**: Risk-free rate or long-term GDP growth

**Exit Multiple Method (Alternative):**
```
Terminal Value = Final Year EBITDA × Exit Multiple

Where Exit Multiple comes from:
- Industry comparable trading multiples
- Precedent transaction multiples
- Typical range: 8-15x EBITDA
```

**Present Value of Terminal Value:**
```
PV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value / (1 + WACC)^Final Period

Where Final Period accounts for timing:
5-year model with mid-year convention: Period = 4.5
```

**Terminal Value Sanity Check:**
- Should represent 50-70% of Enterprise Value
- If >75%, model may be over-reliant on terminal assumptions
- If <40%, check if terminal assumptions are too conservative

### Step 9: Enterprise to Equity Value Bridge

**Valuation Summary Structure:**

```
(+) Sum of PV of Projected FCFs = $X million
(+) PV of Terminal Value = $Y million
= Enterprise Value = $Z million

(-) Net Debt [or + Net Cash if negative] = $A million
= Equity Value = $B million

÷ Diluted Shares Outstanding = C million shares
= Implied Price per Share = $XX.XX

Current Stock Price = $YY.YY
Implied Return = (Implied Price / Current Price) - 1 = XX%
```

**Critical Adjustments:**
- **Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents**
  - If positive: Subtract from EV (reduces equity value)
  - If negative (Net Cash): Add to EV (increases equity value)
- **Use Diluted Shares**: Includes options, RSUs, convertible securities
- **Other adjustments** (if applicable):
  - Minority interests
  - Pension liabilities
  - Operating lease obligations

**Valuation Output Format:**
```csv
Valuation Component,Amount ($M)
PV Explicit FCFs,X.X
PV Terminal Value,Y.Y
Enterprise Value,Z.Z
(-) Net Debt,A.A
Equity Value,B.B
,,
Shares Outstanding (M),C.C
Implied Price per Share,$XX.XX
Current Share Price,$YY.YY
Where the current price sits in the implied range (inside / above / below)
```

### Step 10: Sensitivity Analysis

Build **three sensitivity tables** at the bottom of the DCF sheet showing how valuation changes with different assumptions:

1. **WACC vs Terminal Growth** - Shows enterprise value sensitivity to discount rate and perpetuity growth
2. **Revenue Growth vs EBIT Margin** - Shows impact of top-line growth and operating leverage
3. **Beta vs Risk-Free Rate** - Shows sensitivity to cost of equity components

**Implementation**: These are simple 2D grids (NOT Excel's "Data Table" feature) with formulas in each cell. Each cell must contain a full DCF recalculation for that specific assumption combination. See Critical Constraints section for detailed requirements on populating all 75 cells programmatically using openpyxl.

<correct_patterns>

This section contains all the CORRECT patterns to follow when building DCF models.

### Scenario Block Selection Pattern - Follow This Approach

**Assumptions are organized in separate blocks for each scenario:**

**CRITICAL STRUCTURE - Three rows per section header:**

```csv
BEAR CASE ASSUMPTIONS (section header, merge cells across)
Assumption,FY1,FY2,FY3,FY4,FY5
Revenue Growth (%),12%,10%,9%,8%,7%
EBIT Margin (%),45%,44%,43%,42%,41%

BASE CASE ASSUMPTIONS (section header, merge cells across)
Assumption,FY1,FY2,FY3,FY4,FY5
Revenue Growth (%),16%,14%,12%,10%,9%
EBIT Margin (%),48%,49%,50%,51%,52%

BULL CASE ASSUMPTIONS (section header, merge cells across)
Assumption,FY1,FY2,FY3,FY4,FY5
Revenue Growth (%),20%,18%,15%,13%,11%
EBIT Margin (%),50%,51%,52%,53%,54%
```

**Each scenario block MUST have a column header row** showing the projection years (FY2025E, FY2026E, etc.) immediately below the section title. Without this, users cannot tell which assumption value corresponds to which year.

**How to reference assumptions - Create a consolidation column:**
1. Case selector cell (e.g., B6) contains 1=Bear, 2=Base, or 3=Bull
2. Create a consolidation column with INDEX or OFFSET formulas to pull from the correct scenario block
3. Projection formulas reference the consolidation column (clean cell references)
4. Each scenario block contains full set of DCF assumptions across projection years

**Recommended consolidation column pattern (using INDEX):**
`=INDEX(B10:D10, 1, $B$6)`

**NOT this - scattered IF statements throughout:**
`=IF($B$6=1,[Bear block cell],IF($B$6=2,[Base block cell],[Bull block cell]))`

The consolidation column approach centralizes logic and makes the model easier to audit.

### Correct Revenue Projection Pattern

**Create a consolidation column with INDEX formulas, then reference it in projections:**

**Step 1 - Consolidation column for FY1 growth:**
`=INDEX([Bear FY1 growth]:[Bull FY1 growth], 1, $B$6)`

**Step 2 - Revenue projection references the consolidation column:**
`Revenue Year 1: =D29*(1+$E$10)`

Where:
- D29 = Prior year revenue
- $E$10 = Consolidation column cell for FY1 growth (contains INDEX formula)
- $B$6 = Case selector (1=Bear, 2=Base, 3=Bull)

**This approach is cleaner than embedding IF statements in every projection formula** and makes it much easier to audit which scenario assumptions are being used.

### Correct FCF Formula Pattern

**Use consolidation columns with INDEX formulas, then reference them in FCF calculations:**

**Consolidation column approach:**
```csv
Item,Formula,Reference
D&A,=E29*$E$21,$E$21 = consolidation column for D&A %
CapEx,=E29*$E$22,$E$22 = consolidation column for CapEx %
Δ NWC,=(E29-D29)*$E$23,$E$23 = consolidation column for NWC %
Unlevered FCF,=E57+E58-E60-E62,E57=NOPAT E58=D&A E60=CapEx E62=Δ NWC
```

**Each consolidation column cell contains an INDEX formula** that pulls from the appropriate scenario block based on case selector. This keeps projection formulas clean and auditable.

Before writing formulas, confirm scenario block row locations and set up consolidation columns.

### Correct Cell Comment Format

**Every hardcoded value needs this format:**

"Source: [System/Document], [Date], [Reference], [URL if applicable]"

**Examples:**
```csv
Item,Source Comment
Stock price,Source: Market data script 2025-10-12 Close price
Shares outstanding,Source: 10-K FY2024 Page 45 Note 12
Historical revenue,Source: 10-K FY2024 Page 32 Consolidated Statements
Beta,Source: Market data script 2025-10-12 5-year monthly beta
Consensus estimates,Source: Management guidance Q3 2024 earnings call
```

### Correct Assumption Table Structure

**CRITICAL: Each scenario block requires THREE structural elements:**

1. **Section header row** (merged cells): e.g., "BEAR CASE ASSUMPTIONS"
2. **Column header row** showing years - THIS IS REQUIRED, DO NOT SKIP
3. **Data rows** with assumption values

**Structure:**
```csv
BEAR CASE ASSUMPTIONS (section header - merge across columns A:G)
Assumption,FY1,FY2,FY3,FY4,FY5
Revenue Growth (%),X%,X%,X%,X%,X%
EBIT Margin (%),X%,X%,X%,X%,X%
Terminal Growth,X%,,,,
WACC,X%,,,,

BASE CASE ASSUMPTIONS (section header - merge across columns A:G)
Assumption,FY1,FY2,FY3,FY4,FY5
Revenue Growth (%),X%,X%,X%,X%,X%
EBIT Margin (%),X%,X%,X%,X%,X%
Terminal Growth,X%,,,,
WACC,X%,,,,

BULL CASE ASSUMPTIONS (section header - merge across columns A:G)
Assumption,FY1,FY2,FY3,FY4,FY5
Revenue Growth (%),X%,X%,X%,X%,X%
EBIT Margin (%),X%,X%,X%,X%,X%
Terminal Growth,X%,,,,
WACC,X%,,,,
```

**WITHOUT the column header row showing projection years (FY2025E, FY2026E, etc.), users cannot tell which assumption value corresponds to which year. This row is MANDATORY.**

**Then create a consolidation column** (typically the next column to the right) that uses INDEX formulas to pull from the selected scenario block based on the case selector. This consolidation column is what your projection formulas reference.

### Correct Row Planning Process

**1. Write ALL headers and labels FIRST:**
```csv
Row,Content
1,[Company Name] DCF Model
2,Ticker | Date | Year End
4,Case Selector
7,KEY ASSUMPTIONS
26,Assumption headers
27-31,Growth assumptions
...,...
```

**2. Write ALL section dividers and blank rows**

**3. THEN write formulas using the locked row positions**

**4. Test formulas immediately after creation**

**Think of it like construction:**
- Good: Pour foundation, then build walls (stable structure)
- Bad: Build walls, then pour foundation (walls collapse)

**Excel version:**
- Good: Add headers, then write formulas (formulas stable)
- Bad: Write formulas, then add headers (formulas break)

### Correct Sensitivity Table Implementation

**IMPORTANT**: These are NOT Excel's "Data Table" feature. These are simple grids where you write regular formulas using openpyxl. Yes, this means ~75 formulas total (3 tables × 25 cells each), but this is straightforward and required.

**Programmatic Population with Formulas:**

Each sensitivity table must be fully populated with formulas that recalculate the implied share price for each combination of assumptions. **Do not use Excel's Data Table feature** (it requires manual intervention and cannot be automated via openpyxl).

**Implementation approach - CONCRETE EXAMPLE:**

**Table Structure — 5×5 grid (ODD dimensions, base case centered):**

If the model's base WACC = 9.0% and base terminal growth = 3.0%, build the axes symmetrically around those values:

```csv
WACC vs Terminal Growth,  2.0%,  2.5%,  3.0%,  3.5%,  4.0%
              8.0%,       [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml]
              8.5%,       [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml]
              9.0%,       [fml], [fml], [★  ], [fml], [fml]   ← middle row = base WACC
              9.5%,       [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml]
             10.0%,       [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml]
                                   ↑
                          middle col = base terminal g
```

**★ = the center cell.** Its formula output MUST equal the model's actual implied share price (from the valuation summary). Apply the medium-green fill (`#CBDCCB`) and bold font to this cell so the base case is visually anchored.

**Rule for axis values:** `axis_values = [base - 2*step, base - step, base, base + step, base + 2*step]` — symmetric around the base, odd count guarantees a center.

**Formula Pattern - Cell B88 (WACC=8.0%, Terminal Growth=2.0%):**

The formula in B88 should recalculate the implied price using:
- WACC from row header: `$A88` (8.0%)
- Terminal Growth from column header: `B$87` (2.0%)

**Recommended approach:** Reference the main DCF calculation but substitute these values.

**Example formula structure:**
`=([SUM of PV FCFs using $A88 as discount rate] + [Terminal Value using B$87 as growth rate and $A88 as WACC] - [Net Debt]) / [Shares]`

**CRITICAL - Write a formula for EVERY cell in the 5x5 grid (25 cells per table, 75 cells total).** Use openpyxl to write these formulas programmatically in a loop. Do NOT skip this step or leave placeholder text.

**Python implementation pattern:**
```python
# Pseudocode for populating sensitivity table
for row_idx, wacc_value in enumerate(wacc_range):
    for col_idx, term_growth_value in enumerate(term_growth_range):
        # Build formula that uses wacc_value and term_growth_value
        formula = f"=<DCF recalc using {wacc_value} and {term_growth_value}>"
        ws.cell(row=start_row+row_idx, column=start_col+col_idx).value = formula
```

**The sensitivity tables must work immediately when the model is opened, with no manual steps required from the user.**

</correct_patterns>

<common_mistakes>

This section contains all the WRONG patterns to avoid when building DCF models.

### WRONG: Simplified Sensitivity Table Approximations or Placeholder Text

**Don't use linear approximations:**

```
// WRONG - Linear approximation
B97: =B88*(1+(0.096-0.116))    // Assumes linear relationship

// WRONG - Division shortcut
B105: =B88/(1+(E48-0.07))      // Doesn't recalculate full DCF
```

**Don't leave placeholder text:**
```
// WRONG - Placeholder note
"Note: Use Excel Data Table feature (Data → What-If Analysis → Data Table) to populate sensitivity tables."

// WRONG - Empty cells
[leaving cells blank because "this is complex"]
```

**Don't confuse terminology:**
- ❌ "Sensitivity tables need Excel's Data Table feature" (NO - that's a specific Excel tool we can't use)
- ✅ "Sensitivity tables are simple grids with formulas in each cell" (YES - this is what we build)

**Why these shortcuts are wrong:**
- Linear approximation formulas don't actually recalculate the DCF - they just apply simple math adjustments
- The relationships are not linear, so the results will be inaccurate
- Placeholder text requires manual user intervention
- Model is not immediately usable when delivered
- Not professional or client-ready
- Empty cells = incomplete deliverable

**Common rationalization to REJECT:**
"Writing 75+ formulas feels complex, so I'll leave a note for the user to complete it manually."

**Reality:** Writing 75 formulas is straightforward when you use a loop in Python with openpyxl. Each formula follows the same pattern - just substitute the row/column values. This is a required part of the deliverable.

**Instead:** Populate every sensitivity cell with formulas that recalculate the full DCF for that specific combination of assumptions

### WRONG: Missing Cell Comments

**Don't do this:**
- Create all hardcoded inputs without comments
- Think "I'll add them later"
- Write "TODO: add source"
- Leave blue inputs without documentation

**Why it's wrong:**
- Can't verify where data came from
- Fails xlsx skill requirements
- Not audit-ready
- Wastes time fixing later

**Instead:** Add cell comment AS EACH hardcoded value is created

### WRONG: Formula Row References Off

**Symptom:**
The FCF section references wrong assumption rows:
`D&A:  =E29*$E$34    // Should be $E$21, but referencing wrong row`
`CapEx: =E29*$E$41   // Should be $E$22, but row shifted`

**Why this happens:**
1. Formulas written first
2. Then headers inserted
3. All row references shifted
4. Now formulas point to wrong cells → #REF! errors

**Instead:** Lock row layout FIRST, then write formulas

### WRONG: Single Row for Each Assumption Across Scenarios

**Don't structure assumptions like this:**
```csv
Assumption,Bear,Base,Bull
Revenue Growth FY1,10%,13%,16%
Revenue Growth FY2,9%,12%,15%
```
This vertical layout makes it hard to see the progression across years within each scenario.

**Why it's wrong:**
- Makes it difficult to see assumptions evolving across years within each scenario
- Harder to compare scenario assumptions across full projection period
- Less intuitive for reviewing scenario logic

**Instead:**
- Create separate blocks for each scenario (Bear, Base, Bull)
- Within each block, show assumptions horizontally across projection years
- This makes each scenario's assumptions easier to review as a cohesive set

### WRONG: No Borders

**Don't deliver a model without borders:**
- No section delineation
- All cells blend together
- Hard to read and unprofessional

**Why it's wrong:**
- Not client-ready
- Difficult to navigate
- Looks amateur

**Instead:** Add borders around all major sections

### WRONG: Wrong Font Colors or No Font Color Distinction

**Don't do this:**
- All text is black
- Only use fill colors (no font color changes)
- Mix up which cells are blue vs black

**Why it's wrong:**
- Can't distinguish inputs from formulas
- Auditing becomes impossible
- Violates xlsx skill requirements

**Instead:** Blue text for ALL hardcoded inputs, black text for ALL formulas, green for sheet links

### WRONG: Operating Expenses Based on Gross Profit

**Don't do this:**
`S&M: =E33*0.15    // E33 = Gross Profit (WRONG)`

**Why it's wrong:**
- Operating expenses scale with revenue, not gross profit
- Produces unrealistic margin progression
- Not how businesses actually operate

**Instead:**
`S&M: =E29*0.15    // E29 = Revenue (CORRECT)`

### TOP 5 ERRORS SUMMARY

1. **Formula row references off** → Define ALL row positions BEFORE writing formulas
2. **Missing cell comments** → Add comments AS cells are created, not at end
3. **Simplified sensitivity tables** → Populate all cells with full DCF recalc formulas, not approximations
4. **Scenario block references wrong** → Ensure IF formulas pull from correct Bear/Base/Bull blocks
5. **No borders** → Add professional section borders for client-ready appearance

In addition, be aware of these errors:

### WACC Calculation Errors
- Mixing book and market values in capital structure
- Using equity beta instead of asset/unlevered beta incorrectly
- Wrong tax rate application to cost of debt
- Incorrect risk-free rate (must use current 10Y Treasury)
- Failure to adjust for net debt vs net cash position

### Growth Assumption Flaws
- Terminal growth > WACC (creates infinite value)
- Projection growth rates inconsistent with historical performance
- Ignoring industry growth constraints
- Revenue growth not aligned with unit economics
- Margin expansion without operational justification

### Terminal Value Mistakes
- Using wrong growth method (perpetuity vs exit multiple)
- Terminal value >80% of enterprise value (suggests over-reliance)
- Inconsistent terminal margins with steady state assumptions
- Wrong discount period for terminal value

### Cash Flow Projection Errors
- Operating expenses based on gross profit instead of revenue
- D&A/CapEx percentages misaligned with business model
- Working capital changes not properly calculated
- Tax rate inconsistency between years
- NOPAT calculation errors

**These errors are the most common. Re-read this section before starting any DCF build.**
