```

**Process**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Verify ALL prerequisites before starting
2. Load detailed instructions from references/task5-report-assembly.md
3. Execute report assembly workflow using Claude's built-in skills:
   - **Use DOCX skill** to create and manipulate the Word document
   - **Use XLSX skill** to read Excel data from Task 2/3
   - **Use Read tool** to read Task 1 and Task 3 markdown files
   - Read Task 1 .md file → Convert to Word formatting → Insert charts inline
   - Read Task 2 .xlsx file → Extract tables → Write quantitative analysis
   - Read Task 3 .md file + Excel tabs → Copy/adapt valuation analysis
   - Insert Task 4 .png chart files throughout using DOCX skill
   - Create text-dense report with charts interspersed every 200-300 words
4. Save and deliver final DOCX report

**Key Principles**:
- Use Claude's DOCX and XLSX skills (NOT Python libraries)
- Use actual file operations (read .md/.xlsx/.png files, write .docx file)
- Good equity research reports are text-dense with lots of illustrating images (60-80% page coverage, 1+ chart per page)

**🔥 CRITICAL: GO ALL OUT ON THIS TASK**
