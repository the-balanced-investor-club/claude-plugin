description: Create institutional-quality equity research initiation reports through a 5-task workflow. Tasks must be executed individually with verified prerequisites - (1) company research, (2) financial modeling, (3) valuation analysis, (4) chart generation, (5) final report assembly. Each task produces specific deliverables (markdown docs, Excel models, charts, or DOCX reports). Tasks 3-5 have dependencies on earlier tasks. Triggers on "initiate coverage", "initiation report", "deep dive on [company]", "full research report", "cover this company", "write up this company".

# Initiating Coverage

> **Output:** deliverables carry the blocks defined in `plugins/core/OUTPUT-BLOCK.md`. The connector
> already appends the disclaimer to every response — do not add a second one.

## Data source

Everything comes from The Balanced Investor Club connector: `get_fundamentals`,
`get_income_statement`, `get_balance_sheet`, `get_cash_flow`, `get_valuation_inputs`,
`get_earnings_transcript`, `get_earnings_estimates`, `list_securities_by`, `compare_tickers`,
`get_news`, `get_sector_returns`, `get_industry_returns`.

**If the connector is not available in this session: STOP.** A thirty-page research report built on
recalled figures is the most dangerous artifact this plugin can produce: it is long, it is formatted,
it is confident, and it is wrong, and nothing on the page will look wrong. Tell the user: "I need The
Balanced Investor Club connector for this — it isn't connected in this session. Install the plugin
(or reconnect it), start a new chat, and ask again."

**Do not use web search for market data. Ever.** And **never fabricate chart data**: every series
plotted comes from the model or the connector. A chart built from invented numbers is a lie with axes.

Create institutional-quality equity research initiation reports through a structured 5-task workflow. Each task must be executed separately with verified inputs.

## Overview

This skill produces comprehensive first-time coverage reports following institutional sell-side standards. Tasks are executed individually, each verifying prerequisites before proceeding.

**Default Font**: Inter (fallback Calibri) throughout all documents (unless user specifies otherwise).

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: One Task at a Time

**THIS SKILL OPERATES IN SINGLE-TASK MODE ONLY.**

### If User Requests Full Pipeline

When user requests:
- "Create a coverage initiation report for [Company]"
- "Write an initiation report for [Company]"
- "Do the entire equity research process for [Company]"
- "Complete all 5 tasks for [Company]"
- Any request that implies running multiple tasks or the entire workflow

**REQUIRED RESPONSE:**

1. **Ask which specific task to perform:**
   ```
   I can help you create an equity research initiation report for [Company].
   This involves 5 separate tasks that need to be completed individually:

   1. Company Research - Research business, management, industry
   2. Financial Modeling - Build projection model
   3. Valuation Analysis - DCF and comparable companies
   4. Chart Generation - Create 25-35 charts
   5. Report Assembly - Compile final report

   Which task would you like to start with?
   ```

2. **When user explicitly requests all tasks together:**
   ```
   I understand you'd like to complete the entire initiation report pipeline.
   Currently, this skill supports executing one task at a time, which allows
   for better quality control and review at each stage.

   We're working on a seamless end-to-end workflow that will make this process
   more automated, but for now, we'll need to complete each task separately.

   Would you like to start with Task 1 (Company Research)?
   ```

3. **Never automatically assume which task to start** - always ask user to confirm.

4. **Never execute multiple tasks in sequence** - complete one task, deliver outputs, then wait for next user request.

### Task Execution Rules

- ✅ Execute exactly ONE task per user request
- ✅ Always verify prerequisites before starting a task
- ✅ Deliver task outputs and confirm completion
- ✅ Wait for user to explicitly request the next task
- ❌ Never chain multiple tasks together automatically
- ❌ Never assume user wants to proceed to next task
- ❌ Never execute Tasks 3-5 without verifying required inputs exist

### ⚠️ Deliverables Policy: NO SHORTCUTS

**DELIVER ONLY THE SPECIFIED OUTPUTS. DO NOT CREATE EXTRA DOCUMENTS.**

Each task specifies exact deliverables. Do NOT create:
- ❌ "Completion summaries"
- ❌ "Executive summaries"
- ❌ "Quick reference guides"
- ❌ "Next steps documents"
- ❌ "Task completion reports"
- ❌ Any other "helpful" documentation not explicitly specified

**Why**: These extras waste context and are not part of the professional workflow.

**What TO deliver**:
- ✅ Task 1: Research document (.md) — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 2: Financial model (.xlsx) — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 3: Valuation analysis (.md) + Excel tabs added to Task 2 file — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 4: Charts zip file (.zip) — **NOTHING ELSE**
- ✅ Task 5: Final report (.docx) — **NOTHING ELSE**

**If a deliverable is not listed above, DO NOT CREATE IT.**

## Task Selection

Select which task to execute:

| Task | Name | Prerequisites | Output |
|------|------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | Company Research | Company name/ticker | 6-8K word document |
| **2** | Financial Modeling | 10-K or financials access | Excel model (6 tabs) |
| **3** | Valuation Analysis | Financial model (Task 2) | Valuation range + sensitivity + falsifier |
| **4** | Chart Generation | Tasks 1, 2, 3 + external data | 25-35 PNG/JPG charts |
| **5** | Report Assembly | ALL previous tasks (1-4) | 30-50 page DOCX report |

## How to Use This Skill

### User Request Patterns and Responses

**Pattern 1: User specifies a specific task**
```
User: "Use initiating-coverage, Task 1 for Tesla"
Response: ✅ Execute Task 1 immediately
```

**Pattern 2: User asks for "initiation report" or "full pipeline"**
```
User: "Create a coverage initiation report for Tesla"
Response: ❌ DO NOT start any task automatically
         ✅ Ask which task to start with (see template above)
```

**Pattern 3: User wants to do "all tasks" or "entire workflow"**
```
User: "I want to complete all 5 tasks for Tesla"
Response: ❌ DO NOT chain tasks together
         ✅ Explain one-at-a-time limitation (see template above)
         ✅ Ask if they want to start with Task 1
```

### Correct Usage Examples

**Executing a single task:**
```
"Use initiating-coverage skill, Task 1 for Tesla"
"Do Task 2 of initiating-coverage for Tesla"
"Run Task 3 for Tesla using the initiating-coverage skill"
```

**Completing full report (requires 5 separate requests):**
```
Request 1: "Do Task 1 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 2: "Do Task 2 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 3: "Do Task 3 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 4: "Do Task 4 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
Request 5: "Do Task 5 for Tesla" → Complete → Deliver outputs
```

### Task Execution Order

For a complete initiation report, tasks must be executed in separate user requests following this order:

```
Request 1: Task 1 - Company Research (independent)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 2: Task 2 - Financial Modeling (independent)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 3: Task 3 - Valuation Analysis (requires Task 2 output)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 4: Task 4 - Chart Generation (requires Tasks 2 & 3 outputs)
           ↓ [User reviews outputs and requests next task]
Request 5: Task 5 - Report Assembly (requires ALL previous task outputs)
```

**Note**: Tasks 1 and 2 can be run in any order. Tasks 3-5 have strict dependencies and must verify inputs before proceeding.

---

## Input Verification Protocol

### Why Input Verification Matters

Each task has strict prerequisites. Running a task without required inputs will:
- Waste time with incomplete work
- Produce low-quality outputs
- Require rework

**Always verify inputs before starting a task.**

### Verification Checklist by Task

**Task 1**: ✅ No verification needed (independent)

**Task 2**: Check historical financials available

**Task 3**: Check financial model exists and is accessible

**Task 4**: Check both model (Task 2) AND valuation (Task 3) exist

**Task 5**: Check ALL previous tasks complete (1, 2, 3, 4)

### What to Do if Verification Fails

```
IF prerequisites are missing:
1. Stop the current task
2. Identify which prerequisite task(s) need to be completed
3. Execute the missing task(s) first
4. Return to current task once prerequisites are met
```

### Example Verification Dialogue

```
User: "Use initiating-coverage, Task 5 for Tesla"

Claude: "Starting Task 5: Report Assembly for Tesla

VERIFICATION - Checking prerequisites:
- Task 1 (Company research)... ❌ NOT FOUND
- Task 2 (Financial model)... ❌ NOT FOUND
- Task 3 (Valuation)... ❌ NOT FOUND
- Task 4 (Charts)... ❌ NOT FOUND

⚠️ VERIFICATION FAILED

Task 5 requires ALL previous tasks to be complete.

To proceed:
1. Complete Task 1: Company Research
2. Complete Task 2: Financial Modeling
3. Complete Task 3: Valuation Analysis
4. Complete Task 4: Chart Generation
5. Then return to Task 5

Would you like to start with Task 1 first?"
```

## Task Reference Files

Detailed instructions for each task are in separate reference files to keep this skill lean:

- **references/task1-company-research.md** - Company research workflow
- **references/task2-financial-modeling.md** - Financial modeling workflow
- **references/task3-valuation.md** - Valuation methodology
  - Also see: references/valuation-methodologies.md for DCF/comps deep dive
- **references/task4-chart-generation.md** - Chart generation workflow
- **references/task5-report-assembly.md** - Report writing workflow
  - Also see: assets/report-template.md for report structure
  - Also see: assets/quality-checklist.md for quality checks

**When to load reference files**: Load ONLY the reference file associated with the specific task being performed. These files are very large - do not load multiple reference files at once. Read the appropriate task reference file at the start of the task for detailed step-by-step instructions.

---

## Quality Standards

All outputs meet the standards of leading institutional research desks:

- **Comprehensive**: Meet all minimum requirements
- **Detailed**: Specific data and examples, not generic statements
- **Quantified**: Lead with numbers and metrics
- **Cited**: Proper sources with clickable hyperlinks
- **Professional**: Institutional-quality formatting
- **Accurate**: All numbers verified and cross-checked

---

## Important Notes

### Task Independence

- **Task 1** can run anytime (no dependencies)
- **Task 2** can run anytime (just needs historical data)
- **Tasks 1 & 2** can run in parallel
- **Task 3** requires Task 2
- **Task 4** requires Tasks 2 & 3
- **Task 5** requires Tasks 1, 2, 3, & 4

### Session Management

**Same session**: Outputs automatically available to subsequent tasks

**Different sessions**: Reference previous task outputs explicitly
```
"Use Task 3 with the model from yesterday at [path]"
"Use Task 5 with the research document at [path]"
```

### File Organization

Recommended structure during workflow:
```
ProjectFolder/
├── Task1_Research/
│   └── [Company]_Research_Document.md
├── Task2_Model/
│   └── [Company]_Financial_Model.xlsx
├── Task3_Valuation/
│   └── [Company]_Valuation_Analysis.pdf
├── Task4_Charts/
│   ├── chart_01.png
│   └── ... (25-35 files)
└── Task5_Report/
    └── [Company]_Initiation_Report.docx
```

### No End-to-End Execution

This skill does **NOT** support running all tasks automatically in sequence. Each task must be explicitly requested and verified.

**Why**: This ensures:
- Quality control at each stage
- Ability to review outputs before proceeding
- Flexibility to pause/resume workflow
- Clear verification of prerequisites

---

## Success Criteria

A successful initiation report workflow should:
1. Complete all 5 tasks in order
2. Pass all input verifications
3. Meet all quality standards
4. Produce all required deliverables
5. Numbers cross-check between outputs
6. Final report is publication-ready

**Output quality**: Institutional, top-tier sell-side level
**Use case**: First-time comprehensive coverage of a company

## The five task specifications

**See [references/task-specs.md](references/task-specs.md)** for what each of the five tasks
delivers, its prerequisites, and its verification gate. The detailed workflow for each lives in
`references/task1-company-research.md` through `task5-report-assembly.md`.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **It does not issue a rating or a price target.** Not on the cover, not in the valuation section,
  not anywhere — and the QC checklist now **fails the report if one appears**. In its place sits a
  facts box: the implied value range, what moves it most, and what would prove the read wrong.
- **It does not tell the reader what the company is worth.** It shows what each method implies, how
  far the methods disagree, and what the current price is already assuming. **When DCF says $42 and
  comps say $78, that disagreement is the most informative thing on the page** — averaging it into
  $59 hides it behind a decimal point.
- **It does not invent a chart.** Every series comes from the model or the connector. If the data is
  not there, the chart does not exist.
- **It does not pad to hit a page count.** A page mandate produces filler, and filler in a research
  report is where hallucination lives. **If the analysis is done in twenty pages, it is done.**
- **It does not run more than one task at a time.** Each task is delivered, reviewed, and only then
  is the next one started.
